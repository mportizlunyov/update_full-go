# Update_Full-Go (0.0.10-beta)

Update_Full is a suite of Free & Open-Source scripts written in several shell scripts that allows for simple, customisable, and full updating of a wide variety of Operating Systems through their respective package managers.

This simple script can be used for standard home users, power users with home labs, and even enterprise servers if desired.
